# **Automated Retainer Letter Generator**

This project is a **FastAPI-based backend** with a **Streamlit frontend** that automates the generation of retainer letters for law firms. It integrates **LLMs** to generate content and utilizes the **Tavily Search API** to retrieve basic information about the client company. This system drafts professional, client-specific retainer agreements based on the **Law Society of Alberta's Interactive Retainer Letter**: [Interactive Retainer Letter](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://documents.lawsociety.ab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/31171650/InteractiveRetainerLetter.pdf). The letter serves as a foundational template, guiding the automation process to produce a **first-round draft**, significantly reducing the time and effort required to draft retainer letters from scratch.

To quote the **Law Society of Alberta**: *"Do not blindly cut and paste a retainer letter as it sets out important details of the relationship between you and your client, and you will have to live with what it says."* While this project provides a strong starting point, it is essential that users review and refine the generated letter to ensure accuracy and suitability for each client.

This project was developed as a **proof of concept** to demonstrate a real-world application of **LLMs in legal automation** and explore their potential for **future advancements** (see the Next Steps section below).

## **How to Use**

### **1. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Start the Backend (FastAPI)**

Run the backend using **Uvicorn**:

```sh
uvicorn backend:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

- The backend will be available at **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**.
- You can test the API via the interactive docs at **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)**.

### **3. Start the Frontend (Streamlit)**

Run the frontend using **Streamlit**:

```sh
streamlit run .\frontend.py
```

- This will launch the frontend in your browser.
- Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend.

### **4. Using the Application**

- Fill out the form in the Streamlit interface.
- Submit the form to generate the retainer letter.
- The backend will process the request and provide a downloadable `.docx` file.

### **5. Stopping the Application**

Press `CTRL + C` in both terminal windows to stop the frontend and backend.

## **Taking This to Production**

To make this application production-ready, consider the following improvements:

### **Security Hardening**

- Store API keys in **environment variables** (`.env` file, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
- Implement **authentication** (OAuth2, API Key, or JWT).
- Sanitize **LLM prompt inputs** to prevent prompt injection.
- Apply **rate limiting** and validate request payloads.
- Restrict **file path access** to prevent arbitrary file writes.

### **Performance & Scalability**

- Use **async LLM calls** (`await llm.invoke_async()`).
- Cache **Tavily API responses** to reduce redundant queries.
- Move document generation to **background tasks**.

### **Code Quality & Maintainability**

- Replace **manual HTML parsing** with `BeautifulSoup`.
- Store **configurations in a settings file** (`.env` or YAML).
- Add **logging** using Pythonâ€™s `logging` module.
- Containerize using **Docker**.
- Set up **CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, etc.).

### **Deployment Considerations**

- Deploy behind a **reverse proxy** (Nginx, Traefik) with HTTPS.
- Use **Azure Functions / AWS Lambda** for a **serverless** approach.
- Enable **monitoring & logging** with Prometheus & Grafana.

## **Next Steps**

### **Enhancing Retainer Letter Customization**

This project only scratches the surface of what Generative AI can achieve. While the current implementation primarily relies on **prompt engineering**, the missing component is **structured access to unstructured data**: specifically, previous retainer letters.

By leveraging past retainer letters, law firms can build a structured library that dynamically tailors content to the firm's history with a client. For example, the system could automatically generate an appropriate introduction based on whether the firm has an established relationship with a client or if they operate in an industry the firm is already familiar with.

In practice, legal professionals often use previous retainer letters as templates when drafting new ones, but identifying the most relevant example can be time-consuming. In some cases, it may take hours to locate the most relevant information. By **cataloging retainer letters** based on factors such as **client type, industry, and specific legal matters**, this system could enable more efficient retrieval and reuse of relevant sections.

Additionally, by vectorizing different sections of retainer letters, an AI model could systematically retrieve the most appropriate prior examples for each paragraph type. This would transform the letter-generation process from a simple template-based approach into one that **mimics the work of a junior lawyer** by assembling a well-structured, client-specific first draft with minimal human intervention.

Future development will focus on integrating an internal document repository and applying machine learning techniques to refine content selection, ensuring that generated letters are increasingly aligned with firm-specific best practices.
